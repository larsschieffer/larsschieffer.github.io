# **About Me**

Hi my name is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span>
and I am a 23 year old master's student in computer science with the focus on neural networks and model verification. I recently submitted my master's thesis <b>JANI2PINS: The JANI front-end module for the LTSmin toolset</b>. Now, I'm very excited to use my experience in computer science to support the digital transformation in Germany. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via the contact-details at the bottom of this page. If I do not code, I enjoy reading books as <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/296832/atlas-shrugged-centennial-ed-hc-by-ayn-rand/">Atlas Shrugged</a> or <a style="word-break:break-all" href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/">Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</a>.
